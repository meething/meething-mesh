# Meething-Mesh
Personalized video conferencing in less than 5 minutes. See [Demo](https://meething.github.io/meething-mesh/)

# What is this?
This is a spin off from [Meething](https://github.com/meething/meething). A decentralized video conferencing tool but a P2P version. 

# Why?
We believe there are a lot of people who can use a personalized video conferencing. Either to talk with family/friends or with clients/customers. 

# Whats the catch?
Due to the P2P nature of this version the performance with more than 5 people will go get less. But once you reach that point you can always contact the [Meething Team on Discord](https://discord.gg/4vTnfry) and ask for other options.

# Installation 3min
1. Fork it (1min)
2. Github settings -> GitHub Pages -> choose main branch (2min)

# Configuration 2min
* Colors -> in the assets/css/colors.css. You can change the colors in ```.theme-meething``` or create a new theme. If you add a new theme then activate it in index.html ```<html class="theme-your-theme">```
