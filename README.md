# Meething-Mesh
Personalized video conferencing mesh in less than 5 minutes. See [Demo](https://meething.github.io/meething-mesh/)

#### What is this?
This is a spin off of [Meething](https://github.com/meething/meething). A p2p decentralized video conferencing tool with no middle-man.

#### Why?
We believe there are lots of small user groups who could use a personalized video conferencing facility without any third-party control or interference. Either to talk with family/friends or with clients/customers. 

#### Whats the catch?
Due to the P2P mesh nature of this version the performance with more than ~5-6 participants might degrade. But once you reach that point you can always contact the [Meething Team on Discord](https://discord.gg/4vTnfry) and ask for better options ;)
